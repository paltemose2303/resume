            <td>Origninally from Philadelphia, I graudated <i>summa cum laude </i>from the Univeristy of Pittsburgh in April 2020 with a degree in Chemical Engineering
            and a minor in Chemistry. <br><br>
            
            I enjoy taking on new challenges such as training for triathlons, learning to homebrew, creating coding projects, and cooking creative meals. I've recently completed several Spartan Races, half-marathons, and a Half Ironman. I plan to complete my first (and hopefully not last) fully Ironman in October 2021.<br><br>

            I've taken on several challenges such as buying a used road bike and repairing it myself to prepare for competing in triathlons. Additionally, I've put in countless hours training and consulting with coaches to develop a plan to succeed in my upcoming races. <br><br>

            One of my passions is cooking, and that emerged during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. I missed the dining experience so much that I worked to be able to prepare restaurant style meals at home to replicate eating out.<br><br>

            I have a desire to make a difference in the world and embrace the idea that the future should be better than the past and embrace that innovation and hard work is required to make that possible. <br><br>
